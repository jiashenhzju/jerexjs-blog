Despite the remarkable progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the pre-
vailing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigms remain predominantly confined to the linguistic
space. While recent advancements have focused on bridging the Perception Gap through high-
resolution cropping (e.g., Thinking with Images), they overlook a more fundamental bottleneck:
the Reference Gap. The inherent ambiguity of natural language often fails to provide precise,
unambiguous pointers to complex spatial layouts, leading to logical collapse in tasks requiring
rigorous grounding. In this work, we introduce Thinking with Visual Primitives, a novel
reasoning framework that elevates spatial markers—such as points and bounding boxes—to
“minimal units of thought”. By interleaving these visual primitives directly into the thinking
process, our model can “point” while it “reasons”, effectively grounding its cognitive trajectory
in the physical coordinates of the image. Notably, our framework is built on a highly optimized
architecture with extreme visual token efficiency. Despite its compact model scale and signifi-
cantly lower image-token budget, our model achieves frontier-competitive performance on a
focused suite of challenging visual QA tasks, matching or exceeding models such as GPT-5.4,
Claude-Sonnet-4.6, and Gemini-3-Flash. This demonstrates a path toward more efficient and
scalable System-2-like multimodal intelligence.

The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision has ushered in an era
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of sophisticated scene understanding.
However, as we push these models toward complex reasoning, often conceptualized as Daniel
Kahneman’s “System 2” thinking [23], a fundamental limitation of the current paradigm emerges.
While the internal reasoning of these models, typically manifested as Chain-of-Thought (CoT),
has become increasingly robust in the linguistic domain, it remains largely disjointed from the
visual domain.

Recent efforts to enhance multimodal reasoning, such as the visual-scaling strategies seen
in frontier models [8, 12, 21, 24, 26, 34], have primarily addressed the Perception Gap. By
employing high-resolution cropping and dynamic patching, these models ensure they “see” the
fine-grained details of an image. Yet, “seeing” is not “reasoning”. Even with perfect perception,
MLLMs frequently suffer from logical collapse in tasks involving complex spatial layouts or
dense object interactions. We identify this failure as the Reference Gap: the inherent inability of

## Abstract

Figure 1 | (a) Token consumption across various models for an 800 × 800 resolution image. (b)
Average performance across 7 benchmarks—including counting and spatial reasoning—with in-house
benchmarks excluded. We note that the reported scores cover only a subset of evaluation dimensions
that are directly relevant to the research focus of this paper, and are therefore not indicative of the models’
overall capabilities. For an 800 × 800 input, our model retains only approximately 90 entries in the KV
cache, delivering competitive performance through a highly efficient compression strategy. Best viewed

natural language to serve as a precise, unambiguous pointer within a continuous visual space. In
scenarios like dense counting or multi-step spatial deduction, the model’s linguistic “thoughts”
lose track of the visual entities they intend to reference, leading to cascading hallucinations.
While recent works [6, 27, 32] have explored integrating bounding boxes into the chain-of-
thought process, they primarily treat grounding as a post-hoc verification mechanism to enhance
perception-heavy tasks. These approaches are often confined to high-resolution benchmarks
where the challenge is “seeing” rather than “reasoning”, and their reliance on labor-intensive
supervision further limits scalability. More importantly, they fail to address the Reference Gap
in complex structural reasoning—such as topological navigation—where visual markers must
function as the intrinsic medium of thought rather than merely verifiable evidence.

In this work, we propose a paradigm shift: Thinking with Visual Primitives. We move
beyond treating visual grounding as a secondary task or a final output. We elevate spatial
markers—points and bounding boxes—to “minimal units of thought” that are interleaved
directly into the model’s reasoning trajectory. This mechanism draws inspiration from human
cognitive processes. When navigating a complex maze or counting a dense collection of objects,
humans naturally employ deictic pointers—such as finger gestures—to reduce cognitive load
and maintain logical consistency. By interleaving visual primitives into the thinking process, our
model mimics this “point-to-reason” synergy, effectively anchoring abstract linguistic thoughts
onto concrete spatial coordinates.

Furthermore, our framework is built upon an architecturally efficient foundation [3] designed
for high-throughput, long-context multimodal interactions. Unlike traditional approaches
that rely on massive visual token sequences to compensate for visual deficiencies, our model
leverages Compressed Sparse Attention [3] that compress the Key-Value (KV) cache of every 𝑚

visual token into one entry. This design allows the model to operate with only a fraction of the
visual tokens used by other frontier systems, while maintaining comparable cognitive depth.

Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that Thinking with Visual Primitives
delivers a significant leap in reasoning accuracy. Our model achieves competitive performance,
standing on par with or surpassing the latest iterations of GPT, Claude, and Gemini across
a wide spectrum of challenging spatial reasoning and visual QA tasks (seeing Fig. 1). Our
findings suggest that the future of multimodal intelligence lies not just in seeing more pixels,
but in developing more precise and less ambiguous referential mechanisms that bridges the gap
between language and the visual world.

This section first introduces the model architecture. Next, we elaborate on the training pipeline,
as illustrated in Fig. 2, and describe the corresponding data used across the pretraining and
post-training phases.

Our model adopts a standard architecture similar to LLaVA [18, 19]. Specifically, input images are
processed by a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract visual features, which are then concatenated
with language instructions to form an interleaved sequence of vision-language tokens. This
sequence is subsequently fed into the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate responses. The
language backbone is instantiated with DeepSeek-V4-Flash [3], a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model comprising 284B total parameters and 13B active parameters during inference.

For visual encoding, we employ DeepSeek-ViT, an in-house ViT trained from scratch that
supports arbitrary-resolution inputs. It first partitions the input image using a 14 × 14 patch
size to generate patch tokens. Subsequently, at the ViT output, we apply a 3 × 3 spatial token

(b) Training Pipeline compression (compressing every 9 adjacent patch tokens into a single token along the channel
dimension). Furthermore, leveraging the Compressed Sparse Attention (CSA) mechanism
integrated within the base LLM, the visual tokens stored in the Key-Value (KV) cache are further
compressed by a factor of 4.

To illustrate this pipeline, consider an input image of 756 × 756 resolution comprising 571, 536
pixels. The patch embedding layer processes this into 2, 916 image patch tokens for the ViT.
Following the 3 × 3 compression, only 3241 visual tokens are fed into the LLM during the
prefilling stage. Ultimately, the CSA mechanism reduces this to a mere 81 visual KV entries in
the KV cache. Throughout this entire process, from raw pixels to the final KV cache entries, the
system achieves an overall compression ratio of 7, 056×.

During the pretraining phase, our objective is to equip the model with the fundamental capability
to output “visual primitives”. We identify two standard output formats in computer vision as
primitives: bounding boxes and points. Both representations fulfill the crucial role of spatial
referencing. However, they exhibit distinct functional advantages: bounding boxes are adept at
capturing the exact location and scale of specific objects, while points are more appropriate for
abstract visual referencing, such as tracking motion trajectories or solving topological reasoning
problems.

While existing public datasets, such as COCO [17] and Pixmo-Points [4], provide relatively
accurate box or point annotations, they suffer from insufficient scale and a notable lack of
diversity. To ensure the generalizability of our “Thinking with Visual Primitives” paradigm, it is
imperative to curate large-scale web data with rich semantics and high diversity. We prioritize
the extensive scaling of bounding box data for the following reasons:

1To balance performance and computational cost, we restrict the number of visual tokens output by the ViT to
a range of 81 to 384. Images with resolutions falling outside this range are resized while preserving their original
aspect ratio.

#### 2.3. Pretraining

#### 2.3.1. Definition of Visual Primitives

#### 2.3.2. Motivation for Large-Scale Data Curation

- • Determinism of Annotations: A bounding box tightly encloses an object, making its
- annotation relatively deterministic. Conversely, point annotations are highly ambiguous;
- any coordinate within the object’s boundaries can serve as a valid reference, leading to the
- absence of a strict ground truth. In extreme scenarios involving occlusion, a point intended
- for a background object might fall onto a foreground occluder, resulting in significant
- ambiguity.
- • Task Generalizability: A model trained to output bounding boxes can effortlessly gen-
- eralize to point-based formats. Since a bounding box can be defined by two points (the
- top-left and bottom-right coordinates), it inherently encompasses the point representation.
- • Information Richness: Bounding boxes support a broader range of downstream tasks
- compared to points. While a point merely provides spatial localization, a bounding box
- encapsulates detailed geometric information (e.g., width and height). This additional
- context enables the model to perform more complex reasoning within the “Thinking with
- Visual Primitives” framework.

Raw Data Acquisition. We acquire a massive volume of internet data related to box grounding
by conducting large-scale web scraping across multiple websites. Taking Huggingface as
an example, we utilize its official API to filter task data tagged with “Object Detection” or
“Grounding”. We perform an initial screening based on popularity metrics (e.g., rankings by
likes and downloads) and rigorously exclude all validation and test splits to prevent potential
data contamination (i.e., data leakage) during model evaluation. Furthermore, we employ an
LLM-based agent to parse the README.md files of these repositories, automatically converting
the diverse dataset structures into our predefined, unified storage format. Following extensive
crawling and deduplication across these website, we ultimately curate 97, 984 box-grounding-
related data sources. Manual inspection of the sampled data reveals a highly diverse range
of object categories, spanning from common targets (e.g., people, faces) to domain-specific
entities (e.g., lesion regions in CT scans or specific anime characters). However, these raw
box annotations still suffer from various issues, such as semantic ambiguity and geometric
inaccuracy, necessitating further rigorous filtering. We design a two-step filtering pipeline, as
illustrated below.

Step I: Semantic-based Review. Given that the directly crawled datasets are replete with
noisy labels unsuitable for vision-language alignment training, we introduce an automated,
MLLM-driven semantic review mechanism. While traditional data filtering primarily focuses on
the geometric accuracy of bounding boxes, this stage aims to ensure the validity of the semantic
label. Specifically, this review process focuses on eliminating three categories of fatal semantic
defects:

For each dataset, we sample three images and prompt the model to calculate a quality score
(ranging from 0 to 10) based on the aforementioned criteria. The model then outputs a definitive
“KEEP” or “DISCARD” decision, accompanied by a clear justification. This review stage retains
43, 141 out of the initial 97, 984 data sources, which are subsequently advanced to the next
filtering phase.

Step II: Visual-Geometric Quality Review. We further evaluate the geometric quality and
annotation completeness of the bounding boxes to ensure the model learns precise region-text
alignments. This process specifically targets three types of structural annotation defects:

#### 2.3.3. Large-Scale Web Data Construction

- • Meaningless Machine Codes and Gibberish: Many raw datasets retain internal devel-
- opment codes (e.g., pure numeric classes like “0” or “1”). Since these labels lack human-
- readable natural language semantics, forcing the model to learn such mappings would
- severely degrade its language generation capabilities. Thus, they are directly discarded.
- • Ungeneralizable Private Entities: Certain datasets employ specific personal pronouns
- (e.g., “MyRoommate”) or private identifiers (e.g., “ID_Card_1”). Because an MLLM cannot
- generalize the visual features of a non-public figure from isolated samples (i.e., the visual
- features of “someone” cannot generalize to a universal concept), such data are strictly
- filtered out. Conversely, widely recognized celebrities or public figures are retained.
- • Ambiguous Abbreviations and Subjective Evaluations: Labels common in specific
- domains (e.g., industrial inspection), such as “OK” or “NG” (Not Good), often lack
- concrete visual descriptiveness. For instance, a bare “OK” label introduces extreme
- semantic ambiguity, as an “intact apple” and an “intact circuit board” share absolutely no
- visual correlation.

- • Severe Missing Annotations (Low Recall): This refers to scenarios where multiple in-

This review stage further retained 31, 701 out of the 43, 141 remaining data sources. To
achieve dataset balance, we design a category-based sampling strategy. For each category
within every dataset, we randomly sample 𝑁images associated with that class (if the total
number of available images for a category is less than 𝑁, all are retained). Since a single image
may simultaneously belong to multiple categories, we perform global deduplication on the
aggregated set after the per-category selection. In practice, we set 𝑁= 1, 000, ultimately yielding
over 40 million high-quality samples.

For general multimodal data, we predominantly utilize large-scale web-crawled data rather than
synthetic data generated via model distillation (e.g., synthetic image caption). The raw data un-
dergoes careful curation, and we refrain from utilizing LLMs to rewrite the data content. Regard-
ing the specialized data designed to equip the model with foundational capabilities to output
visual primitives, in addition to the aforementioned web crawling and filtering, we also incorpo-
rate several high-quality public datasets, such as [4, 15, 17, 25, 29, 33]. We establish a unified for-
matting standard for both box grounding and point data. For box grounding tasks, we devise sev-
eral prompt templates, such as “Locate TARGET in this image and report its bounding box coordinates.”,
where TARGET serves as a placeholder for the queried object. The corresponding response for-
mat is formulated as follows: <|ref|>TARGET<|/ref|><|box|>[[x1,y1,x2,y2],[x3,y3,
x4,y4]...]<|/box|>, where <|ref|>, <|/ref|>, <|box|>, and <|/box|> are special to-
kens within the vocabulary. x1,y1 and x2,y2 denote the top-left and bottom-right coordi-
nates of the bounding box. These coordinates are normalized to discrete integers ranging
from 0 to 999. In scenarios with multiple instances, the bounding boxes are ordered from
left to right. Similarly, for point tasks, we design prompt templates such as “Help me find
TARGET. Give me the center point for each instance.” The expected response format is defined
as: <|point|>[[x1,y1],[x2,y2]...]<|/point|>, where <|point|> and <|/point|>
are special tokens, and x1,y1 denotes the point coordinates. Notably, in contrast to the box
grounding format, the response paradigm for point tasks does not require outputting the object
name. This design choice aims to extend point-based representations to more abstract concepts,
such as utilizing a sequence of points to denote a trajectory. Ultimately, the whole pretraining
phase consumes trillions of multimodal tokens.

#### 2.3.4. Unified Pretraining

stances corresponding to the given label exist in the image, but only a few are annotated. If
a large-scale missing annotation issue (e.g., a miss rate >50%) is detected during sampling,
the dataset is immediately discarded.
• Severe Truncation and Offset: This occurs when bounding boxes fail to reasonably enclose
the target objects. In practice, we adopt a differential tolerance strategy: slightly loose
boxes (incorporating minor background noise) are deemed acceptable; however, severe
truncations that slice through critical visual features of the object (e.g., cutting off a head
or wheels) are strictly unacceptable.
• Mega Boxes Issue: If a bounding box meaninglessly covers over 90% of the image area, it
is typically indicative of image classification data being forcibly converted into detection
data. If this occurs only occasionally within a sampled batch, it is treated as acceptable
noise. However, if such global boxes consistently appear across all three sampled images,
the dataset is considered to lack meaningful localization information and is discarded.

Cold-Start Data for Post-Training. While pretraining equips the model with general multimodal
priors and basic visual primitive capabilities, post-training (Specialized SFT/RL and the subse-
quent unified RFT) needs a small but high-precision cold-start dataset to bootstrap instruction
following and reward learning under our visual primitive output interface. Concretely, we
construct cold-start data with (i) explicit supervision targets derived from annotations (e.g.,
boxes/points) or programmatically generated, (ii) automatic verifiers (e.g., rule-based checkers)
whenever possible to reduce label noise. We selected representative tasks that benefit from
visual primitive-based reasoning (via boxes or points), and designed our cold-start data across
four key dimensions: counting, spatial reasoning & general visual QA, maze navigation, and
path tracing.

Multimodal Large Language Models consistently struggle with accurate counting, particularly
in dense scenes. Unlike humans, who typically employ a systematic scanning-and-accumulation
strategy, language-based models often fail to establish precise object correspondences when the
object count is high. We address this fundamental bottleneck by employing bounding boxes as
visual primitives to provide explicit referential anchors.

Task Decomposition. We categorize counting tasks into two types: Coarse-grained Counting and
Fine-grained Counting. The former focuses on counting general categories (e.g., “dogs”), while
the latter requires distinguishing objects based on specific attributes or spatial constraints (e.g.,
“white dogs” or “the dog on the left”).

Coarse-Grained Counting. We aggregate data from multiple dense detection datasets, including
[2, 9, 14, 22, 28, 29, 35]. To ensure data quality, we implement a filtering process based on three
primary criteria: avoiding excessive object density, ensuring bounding boxes are sufficiently
large for clear identification, and maintaining a high recall rate for ground-truth box annotations.
For the filtered samples, we prompt an MLLM to generate thinking content and concise final
response based on the images and box annotations. The thinking content generation follows a
structured three-step protocol: (1) Intent Analysis, where the model identifies the target category;
(2) Batch Grounding, where the model utilizes visual primitives to locate all candidate objects
simultaneously (we found that batch grounding is more efficient for coarse-grained tasks as it
leverages the model’s inherent localization strengths while preventing repetitive enumeration);
and (3) Statistical Summation, based on the visual primitives. To eliminate noise during cold-start
training, we implement a strict verification mechanism to ensure that all box visual primitives in
the thinking content strictly align with the metadata coordinates, follow the predefined syntax,
and match the final numerical count.

Fine-Grained Counting. Due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets specifically for
fine-grained counting, we developed a specialized data construction pipeline. (1) Question
Generation: Leveraging the images and scene-graph metadata from GQA [10], we prompt
an MLLM to curate informative fine-grained counting questions. Samples that fail to yield
meaningful questions are discarded. For each valid sample, we record the ground-truth object
IDs, the IDs of excluded negative candidates, and the underlying rationale for the QA pair
construction. (2) Thinking Content Synthesis: Using the image, scene graph, and the previously
generated question (along with its associated IDs and rationale) as input, we guide the MLLM
to synthesize a reasoning chain integrated with visual primitives. While the overall thinking
structure mirrors that of coarse-grained counting, the model is explicitly instructed to perform a

sequential scan—systematically identifying and verifying each possible object in the scene against
the specified fine-grained constraints. We also applied this methodology to construct negative
samples where the ground-truth count is zero, thereby enhancing the model’s robustness against
hallucinations.

In total, we have approximately 10, 000 cold-start samples for counting task. Examples could
be seen in Fig. 3.

We consolidate spatial reasoning and general VQA into a unified category. This integration
effectively mitigates the referential ambiguity and semantic drift inherent in purely linguistic
descriptions. In constructing our cold-start data, we prioritize spatial reasoning tasks, under
the hypothesis that the capability to think with visual primitives developed here will naturally
generalize to broader VQA scenarios. Our data curation covers both natural and synthetic
environments.

The user wants me to count the total number of men in the image. This looks like a team photo. I need to 
count everyone present: the players in the team kit (striped jerseys) as well as the coaches or officials 
standing on the sides in regular clothes.
2. **Sweeping the photo for men**
Looking at the group, I’ll identify all the men across the different rows. Here they are: <｜ref｜>the

the middle row seated or crouching, the back row standing, and the four non-players (two on the far left, 
two on the far right) dressed in suits/sweaters.
3. **Tallying the group**
Counting everyone up, there are 4 guys sitting on the ground in the front row, 9 players seated in the 
middle row, 8 players standing in the back row, plus 2 coaches/officials on the left and 2 on the right. 4 + 9 
+ 8 + 2 + 2 = 25. The total number is 25.

Thinking with Visual Primitives
1. **What am I looking for** 
The question asks me to count the bears that are on the ground. I need to scan the entire scene, locate all 
the bears, and check their positions to ensure I only count those standing on the earth or rocks, excluding 
any that might be elevated or climbing. 
2. **Evaluating each bear's position** 
Starting my scan near the top of the image, I spot a <｜ref｜>bear<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[452,23,804,411]]
<｜/box｜> clinging vertically to a tall, dead tree trunk. Because it is climbing and clearly not on the 
ground, I will exclude it from my count. Looking lower down towards the left side of the scene, I see a large 
<｜ref｜>bear<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[50,447,647,771]]<｜/box｜> walking along a rocky edge. This one is 
standing firmly on the terrain, so it meets the criteria. Scanning just below and to the right of that ledge, I 
find another <｜ref｜>bear<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[380,645,868,961]]<｜/box｜> positioned among some 
broken pieces of wood and dirt. This bear is also on the ground surface, so it counts as well. 
3. **Tally of bears on the ground** 
Out of the three bears visible in the image, one is high up in a tree and two are walking on the rocky ground 
below. The total count is 2.

multi-hop logical inference. Best viewed on screen with zoom.

we prompt an MLLM to design questions centered on spatial relations and object interactions,
along with corresponding thinking content. The generated thinking content follows a structured
process, including intent analysis, object grounding, and relational inference. To resolve potential
ambiguities in crowded scenes, the model is instructed to select distinctive objects and apply
multi-attribute constraints (e.g., combining actions and properties) to uniquely specify the target.
However, due to the relatively simple relational structure in GQA, it remains challenging to
generate complex, multi-hop reasoning samples at scale. To overcome this limitation and fully
unlock the model’s potential, we further incorporate complex synthetic data.

Data Construction in Synthetic Scenes. We leverage the CLEVR [13] toolchain to generate multi-
hop reasoning data. This framework supports controllable scene generation with varying object
densities, along with question generation and programmatic execution traces that map each
reasoning step to object-level references (e.g., specific object IDs). To supervise the generation of
visual primitives, we project 3D object coordinates onto 2D bounding boxes based on the official
toolchain. Given the rendered images, scene graphs, questions, answers, and execution traces,
we prompt the MLLM to synthesize “Thinking with Visual Primitives” chains, which include
intent analysis, task decomposition, and multi-hop grounded reasoning. An example could be
seen in Fig. 4.

Negative Sample Augmentation. To enhance the model’s reliability, we construct negative
training samples where the queried objects or relationships do not exist. In such cases, the model
is trained to provide a “faithful refusal” based on the visual evidence rather than generating
fabricated responses.

Is there a purple rubber object that has 
the same size as the gray metallic object?

Original Image

Image with Visual Primitives

1. **Analyzing the request** 
The user is asking to verify if there is a "purple rubber object" that shares the same size as the "gray metallic 
object". This requires a multi-step attribute verification and comparison: first, I must locate the gray 
metallic object to determine its relative size in the scene. Second, I need to scan the scene for any purple 
rubber objects that match this specific size. 
2. **Locating the gray metallic object**
 Scanning the objects in the scene, I spot a gray, highly reflective spherical object in the background towards 
the upper center-right. This is the <｜ref｜>small gray metal sphere<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[502,209,555, 
288]] <｜/box｜>. Comparing it to the large cube, large sphere, and large cylinder, it is clearly categorized as 
a small object. 
3. **Searching for a matching purple rubber object** 
Since the gray metallic object is small, I need to look for a small purple rubber object. I will systematically 
check the other small objects in the scene: 
- Right next to the gray sphere, there is a <｜ref｜>small brown metal cylinder<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[462,255,519,367]]<｜/box｜>. It is brown and metallic. 
- To the left, there is a <｜ref｜>small blue metal cube<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[301,300,386,429]]<｜/box｜>. 
It is blue and metallic. 
- Further right, in the mid-ground, there is a matte <｜ref｜>small blue rubber cube<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[599,325,684,458]]<｜/box｜>. It is rubber, but its color is blue. 
- Right beside that blue cube, there is a <｜ref｜>small yellow rubber cylinder<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[647,281,711,397]]<｜/box｜>. It is yellow. 
- On the far right edge of the cluster, there is a <｜ref｜>small blue metal sphere<｜/ref｜><｜box｜

In total, we generated 9, 000 cold-start samples for the spatial reasoning and general VQA

While MLLMs have shown proficiency in solving advanced scientific problems, a robust
paradigm for topological reasoning remains elusive. Purely linguistic CoT struggles to ac-
curately describe trajectories of irregular shapes. To address this gap, Thinking with Visual
Primitives, which could employ points as cognitive units, is uniquely suited for such challenges.
We first introduce a maze navigation task that requires the model to determine the solvability
of a maze—a process that demands a fundamental understanding of spatial connectivity and
reachability. We construct our cold-start data through synthetic data generation, the details of
which are provided below.

Design Methodology. We use Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim, and Kruskal algorithms to
produce solvable and non-trivial mazes. All three algorithms generate challenging mazes where

I'll use a trial-and-error strategy to explore this maze. First locate the starting point: <｜point｜>[[309,512]]<｜/point｜>, and the destination: 
<｜point｜>[[652,644]]<｜/point｜>.

**Start Exploring**:

**Step1**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[357,369]]<｜/point｜> after going upper-right, I face 2 directions to choose from (lower-right, left).lower-right 
direction might also be correct, but I'll explore left direction first.
**Step2**: Moving left: <｜point｜>[[357,369],[260,372]]<｜/point｜>...reaching <｜point｜>[[260,372]]<｜/point｜>, I see 2 forks here. Observing that 
upper-right direction is a straight dead end at <｜point｜>[[310,226]]<｜/point｜>, can see wall directly. Still need to explore left direction.
**Step3**: Walking left: <｜point｜>[[260,372],[161,375]]<｜/point｜>...arriving at <｜point｜>[[161,375]]<｜/point｜>, this is another junction with 3
paths. Observing that upper-right direction is a straight dead end at <｜point｜>[[211,226]]<｜/point｜>, can see wall directly; upper-left direction to 
<｜point｜>[[113,226]]<｜/point｜> is obviously a dead end. Still need to explore lower-left direction.
**Step4**: Moving lower-left: <｜point｜>[[161,375],[113,518],[211,515],[261,656],[162,658],[213,796]]<｜/point｜>...reaching <｜point｜>[[213,796]]
<｜/point｜>, I see 2 forks here. Observing that right direction is a straight dead end at <｜point｜>[[310,791]]<｜/point｜>, can see wall directly; left 
direction is a straight dead end at <｜point｜>[[113,791]]<｜/point｜>, can see wall directly. All directions are obviously dead ends, need to backtrack.
**Step5**: This path is blocked, backtracking to the previous junction <｜point｜>[[260,372]]<｜/point｜>, trying another direction.
**Step6**: All paths in this branch are explored, all dead ends. Going back to main junction <｜point｜>[[357,369]]<｜/point｜>, taking lower-right 
direction.
**Step7**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[357,369]]<｜/point｜> after going upper-right, I face 2 directions to choose from (lower-right, left).left direction was 
already explored, it's a dead end.
**Step8**: Heading towards lower-right: <｜point｜>[[357,369],[408,510],[457,650]]<｜/point｜>
**Step9**: The path is clear, going directly to the exit: <｜point｜>[[457,650],[554,648],[506,507],[603,507],[652,645]]<｜/point｜>
**Step10**: Up ahead <｜point｜>[[652,645]]<｜/point｜> is the destination! Through systematic exploration, I find the correct path.

**Final Path**: After exploration, the correct route is:
<｜point｜>[[310,513],[357,369],[408,510],[457,650],[554,648],[506,507],[603,507],[652,645]]<｜/point｜>

Successfully reaching the destination: <｜point｜>[[652,644]] <｜/point｜>!

Response
The maze is solvable. The verified path is:
<｜point｜>[[310,513],[357,369],[408,510],[457,650],[554,648],[506,507],[603,507],[652,645]]<｜/point｜>

only few paths exist between any two cells, ensuring solutions that cannot be trivially guessed.
We design three maze topologies: rectangular grids, circular mazes composed of concentric rings
with angular sectors, and hexagonal (honeycomb) lattices. To enhance model robustness, we
additionally designed a series of unsolvable mazes. We first generate a solvable maze and obtain
the solution paths, then deliberately place a few walls around the middle of that path—avoiding
areas too close to the start or end. This breaks the connectivity in a less obvious way, making
the maze appear solvable at first glance, but actually requiring a full search to confirm that no
valid path exists. We apply diverse visual styles including gradient and extra-thick walls, varied
background patterns, multiple marker types, and random small-angle rotations to prevent
overfitting to specific visual patterns. Image resolutions are randomized, and aspect ratios are
continuously sampled, with grid dimensions adjusted proportionally.

Difficulty Control. The difficulty of maze navigation largely depends on how many visual
reasoning steps the model needs to chain together. We control this by changing the grid size.
As the grid becomes larger, the model has to parse more cells, track connectivity over longer
distances, and deal with more dead ends that require backtracking. Each of these adds to
the overall reasoning complexity. Concretely, easy mazes require the model to chain only a
handful of local connectivity checks, while nightmare-level mazes demand sustained, long-
range composition of hundreds of such primitive operations without losing track of previously
explored regions. We enforce minimum resolution thresholds at each difficulty level to ensure
that the visual primitives remain perceptible, even in the hardest configurations. This ensures
that task difficulty stems from reasoning complexity rather than visual ambiguity.

Thinking Content Synthesis. We design several natural language formats and templates to
produce descriptions of the DFS-based exploration process, including forward exploration and
backtracking. Each exploration step is grounded to the image via pointing coordinates, explicitly
converting visual primitive operations—checking wall connectivity at a cell, advancing to an
adjacent cell, or retreating from a dead end—into verbalized reasoning chains. This serves as the
cold start supervision for teaching the model to think with visual primitives rather than merely
perceive them. The final output indicates whether the maze is solvable and, if so, provides a
verified solution path.

In total, we generate 460, 000 cold-start samples with various difficulties for the task of Maze
Navigation. An example is shown is Fig. 5.

In addition to the maze navigation task, we further design a path tracing task to enhance the
model’s ability to leverage visual primitives for reasoning across diverse scenarios. The task
ask the model to follow a specified curve through a tangle of overlapping lines to identify the
endpoint it reaches. We instantiate this task as line tracing through procedurally generated
images of entangled curves, where each line connects a uniquely labeled start point to an
endpoint.

Design Methodology. We generate images which consist of multiple Bézier curves, each
connecting a labeled start point to a labeled endpoint. The central challenge lies in intersection
disambiguation: wherever two lines cross, the model must invoke a local geometric-continuity
primitive to decide which branch continues the target curve. To ensure this primitive is genuinely
tested, we carefully prevent any endpoint from overlapping with or being crossed by an
unrelated line, discarding and regenerating configurations that violate these constraints. We
further include a uniform-style mode in which every line shares the same color and stroke

and end points, then traces the line using visual primitives. Best viewed on screen with zoom.

width, stripping away color-based shortcuts and forcing the model to rely solely on curvature
continuity at crossings—a direct test of whether the path-tracing primitive has been internalized
rather than approximated by color matching. Difficulty scales naturally with the number of lines
and their curvature amplitude: easy instances present a few gently curving lines with sparse
crossings, while harder instances pack many tightly wound curves into the canvas, multiplying
the intersection points at which the figure-ground primitive must be applied. Image resolutions,
aspect ratios, and visual styles (color palettes, line styles, endpoint markers, backgrounds) are
all randomized to prevent superficial pattern matching.

Thinking Content Synthesis. We explicitly represent the path-tracing process as a sequence
of coordinates sampled along the target curve, which reflects how the model attends to and
follows the path across the image. The process starts by locating the queried start point, then
follows the curve through a series of intermediate waypoints, and finally identifies the endpoint
reached. Importantly, the density of these waypoints adapts to the local geometry of the curve.
Straightforward segments are represented with fewer points, while highly curved regions or
dense intersections are described with finer-grained coordinates, mirroring how a human would
slow down and pay closer attention in visually complex regions.

In total, we generate 125, 000 cold-start samples across different difficulty levels for the task
of Path Tracing. An example is shown is Fig. 6.

To maximize the learning efficiency of the model for both box and point visual primitives, our
post-training pipeline adopts a “train specialists—then—merge” strategy, which is detailed
below.

In the Specialized SFT phase, the overall training data consists of 70% general multimodal and
pure-text data, and 30% specialized “thinking with visual primitives” data. We conduct SFT

separately using the two types of cold-start data constructed in Section 2.3.4: box (thinking
with grounding) and point (thinking with pointing). This separation prevents mode conflict when
the volume of specialized data is relatively small. After this training phase, we obtain two
specialized models, denoted as FTwG and FTwP.

Subsequently, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) independently to both FTwG and FTwP.
Following [3], we utilize the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and follow
their hyper-parameters. Given that the visual primitives (e.g., boxes and points) within the
thinking content of our cold-start data have been rigorously verified, we do not explicitly
supervise the visual primitives generated during the model’s thinking process in the RL phase.
This design enhances the scalability of the RL training data. Consequently, we only require
images, questions, and final answers when collecting RL data, which significantly broadens the
scope of accessible data.

During training, we design several Reward Models (RMs) to provide concurrent supervision
for each task from three perspectives: format constraints, quality constraints, and accuracy
constraints. The first two constraints are shared across different tasks, while the final accuracy
constraint requires specific designs tailored to the task type.

Format RM. This RM evaluates the output based on rules to generate a reward score ranging
from 0 to 1. Specifically, it verifies whether the representation format of the visual primitives
generated by the model is correct. For thinking with grounding, this RM additionally checks for
redundancy in the model’s output, such as generating duplicate bounding boxes; this effectively
mitigates the issue of the SFT model falling into an infinite loop of box generation.

Quality RM. This is an LLM-based Generative Reward Model (GRM). The Quality RM takes
the thinking content and the final response generated by the model as inputs, and evaluates
them from the following aspects:

Ultimately, the model outputs a score from three discrete tiers [0.0, 0.5, 1.0] and provides a
rationale for the given score. Below, we will introduce the Accuracy RM specific to each task.

Accuracy RM for Counting. To provide a smooth and informative learning signal, we design a
rule-based counting reward model that captures the degree of deviation between the predicted
and ground truth, instead of relying on binary exact-match supervision. Specifically, we apply a
smooth exponential decay over the relative error, so that near-correct predictions are only lightly
penalized, while larger mistakes receive significantly lower scores. The reward 𝑅is given as:

- • Whether there is redundancy in the model’s response.
- • Whether the model’s thinking content is consistent with its final response.
- • Whether there are self-contradictions during the “thinking with visual primitives” process.
- • Whether the referred objects are meaningful entities when the model outputs visual
- primitives in the form of boxes.
- • Whether the model exhibits “reward hacking” behaviors, such as forcefully fabricating a
- fake ground truth identical to its own prediction in the response to deceive the reward
- model.

|𝑦| + 1 where ˆ𝑦and 𝑦denote the predicted and ground-truth counts, respectively. The normalization
term |𝑦| + 1 makes the reward depend on relative error, allowing small deviations to be more
tolerable in scenes with larger object counts. The coefficients 𝛼and 𝛽control the overall reward
scale and decay rate, respectively. In practice, we set 𝛼= 0.7 and 𝛽= 3, which are empirically
chosen to provide stable and smooth learning signals.

Accuracy RM for Spatial Reasoning and General VQA. For these tasks, we design an LLM-
based GRM. We feed the model’s thinking content, its final response, the user query, and the
ground-truth answer into the GRM to independently evaluate and score the thinking process
and the response. The final reward is calculated as the average of the two scores.

Accuracy RM for Maze Navigation. To encourage the model to explore the maze, we design a
rule-based RM. The final reward is a weighted combination of the following components.

This decomposition ensures that the reward signal is dense and informative: the model receives
credit for each correctly applied visual primitive rather than only for the final binary answer.

Accuracy RM for Path Tracing. To enforce the model to trace follow the lines, we propose
a rule-based RM to judge the generated sequences of points. The final reward is a weighted
summation of the following items.

- • Causal exploration progress. We process the model’s step-by-step exploration sequentially.
- Upon encountering the first wall violation (i.e., where the model claims to move between
- two cells separated by a wall), we truncate all subsequent exploration, as it is causally
- invalidated. Then, we calculate the shortest distance between the explored regions and
- the endpoint. The score is 1 minus the fraction of the distance and the length of the
- ground-truth path. The score measures how much of the maze was legally explored
- before truncation relative to the optimal reachable region, rewarding thorough and correct
- exploration. This item is only applied for solvable mazes. For unsolvable mazes, this item
- is kept as 1.
- • Exploration completeness. For unsolvable mazes, the model must demonstrate that no
- path exists by exhaustively exploring the reachable region. The score is the fraction of the
- number of explored regions and the number of all the achievable regions. This component
- measures the fraction of truly reachable cells that appear in the model’s (causally valid)
- exploration trace. This item is only applied for unsolvable mazes. For solvable mazes, this
- item is kept as 1.
- • Wall violation penalty. Independent of the causal truncation above, we scan the entire
- exploration trace to count every wall-violating transition. This score is 1 minus the fraction
- of the number of wall-violating transitions and the number of all the legal transitions of
- the maze. This directly penalizes each incorrect connectivity judgment, ensuring that wall
- violations are never cost-free even if they occur late in the exploration.
- • Final path validity. When the model claims the maze is solvable, it must output a concrete
- solution path. We verify both that consecutive cells in this path are legally connected (no
- wall violations) and that the path forms a continuous route from start to end. This item is
- a binary score for solvable mazes. For unsolvable mazes, this item is kept as 1.
- • Answer correctness. A binary score for whether the model’s solvability judgment matches
- the ground truth.

- • Trajectory accuracy. We evaluate the alignment between the predicted trajectory and the
- ground-truth curve from two complementary directions. In the forward direction, for
- each predicted point, we compute its minimum distance any segment of the groundtruth

The bidirectional trajectory evaluation is critical. The forward direction alone would allow the
model to output only a few safe points near the start, while the reverse direction alone would
not penalize hallucinated detours. Together, they incentivize the model to produce a complete
and accurate coordinate trace of the target curve.

RL Data. We expand the data pool during the RL phase. Prior to RL training, we use the SFT
cold-start model (FTwG or FTwP) to perform rollouts over the data pool, generating 𝑁rollouts for
each sample. Subsequently, based on the RM scores, we count the number of correct responses
among the 𝑁rollouts for each sample and categorize the data pool into three difficulty levels:

We select samples from the “Normal-Level” category for RL, ensuring that the model receives
valuable supervisory signals during the GRPO training process. Following the Specialized RL
phase, we obtain two expert models, denoted as ETwG and ETwP.

Equipped with the robust expert models ETwG and ETwP obtained above, we proceed to integrate
the two visual-primitive-based reasoning paradigms—thinking with grounding and thinking with
pointing—into a single unified model. We employ these expert models to perform rollouts over
the data pool to generate RFT data. Applying the previously introduced difficulty categorization
criteria, we retain all samples classified as “Normal-Level” and randomly sub-sample 5% of the
“Easy-Level” data (to prevent catastrophic forgetting in excessively simple scenarios). Leveraging
this larger and more diverse RFT dataset, we initialize from the base pretrained model to train
an enhanced SFT model. Our RFT training configuration remains identical to that of the SFT
cold-start phase (including the training hyper-parameters and the initial checkpoint), with the
only difference being the updated training data mixture. Following this procedure, we obtain
the unified model F.

- • Easy-Level: All 𝑁rollouts are correct.
- • Normal-Level: The number of correct rollouts 𝑘satisfies 1 ≤𝑘< 𝑁.
- • Hard-Level: All 𝑁rollouts are incorrect.

#### 2.5.3. Unified RFT

poly-line, then average the distances across all the predicted points. This item penalizes
points that deviate from the true path. In the reverse direction, for each ground-truth
point, we compute its minimum distance to any segment of the predicted poly-line. This
penalizes incomplete coverage where the model skips portions of the curve. The final
trajectory score is the average of both directions.
• Endpoint accuracy. We separately verify that the model correctly identifies the start
and end locations. For each, we compute the distance between the model’s predicted
coordinate and the ground-truth bounding box center. The score decays with distance,
reaching zero beyond a tolerance threshold.
• Trajectory continuity penalty. If the distance between the last point in the model’s
trajectory and its predicted endpoint exceeds a threshold, a fixed penalty is applied.
This discourages the model from outputting a partial trajectory and then “jumping” to a
guessed endpoint without actually tracing the full path.
• Answer correctness. A score for whether the endpoint label in the model’s final answer
matches the ground truth.

Although the RFT model F demonstrates substantial improvements over the cold-start mod-
els FTwG and FTwP in their respective domains, a noticeable performance gap remains when
compared to the expert models ETwG and ETwP. To bridge this gap, we follow [3] and employ
On-Policy Distillation (OPD) to effectively consolidate the capabilities of the expert models into a
single unified model. This distillation process is achieved by enabling the student model to learn
the output distribution of the teacher models based on its own generated trajectories. Formally,
given a set of 𝑁expert models {𝜋𝐸1, 𝜋𝐸2, . . . , 𝜋𝐸𝑁}, the OPD objective function is defined as:

where 𝑤𝑖denotes the weight assigned to each expert model, DKL represents the reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss, and 𝜋𝜃denotes the student model. We adopt full-
vocabulary logit distillation for our OPD implementation. In practice, we utilize two teacher
models, including ETwG and ETwP.

Our model is trained and evaluated using HAI-LLM [7], a lightweight and efficient distributed
training framework built upon PyTorch. During the pre-training stage, we employ a sequence
length of 64K and FP8 precision; in the post-training stage, the sequence length is extended to
256K. To maximize the performance of the domain experts, we utilize FP8 precision during the
Specialized SFT and Specialized RL phases, and subsequently apply FP4 (MXFP4) quantization
in the Unified RFT and OPD phases.

Our evaluation framework integrates widely adopted public benchmarks with a curated in-
house suite. While public benchmarks are vital for standardized comparisons, their constrained
evaluation dimensions often fail to capture the full spectrum of a model’s capabilities, e.g.,
thinking with visual primitives. To bridge this gap, our in-house suite introduces more diverse
and challenging axes, serving as a critical complement to the public datasets.

Public Benchmarks.
To evaluate counting capabilities, we use two widely used counting
benchmarks, including CountQA [30] and Pixmo-Count [4]. We follow the standard evaluation
protocols for each dataset, using the official test split for Pixmo-Count. To evaluate spatial
reasoning and general VQA, we use benchmarks such as SpatialMQA [20], CV-Bench [31],
EmbSpatial [5], OmniSpatial [11], and MIHBench [16].

In-House Benchmarks.
To conduct a more granular evaluation of the model’s capacity to
solve tasks by “Thinking with Visual Primitives”, we curate a tailored in-house benchmark suite
spanning three critical dimensions: fine-grained counting, multi-hop spatial reasoning, and
topological reasoning.

Table 1 | Comparison with frontier models. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluated all models
via their respective APIs using an identical set of prompts. The best results are highlighted in
bold; the second-best results are underlined.

For fair comparison, we adopt a unified evaluation protocol across all models. Given that some
legacy public benchmarks contain low-resolution images, we apply a preprocessing step to
ensure data quality. Specifically, any image with a total pixel count below 640, 000 is upscaled
to reach this pixel threshold while strictly preserving its original aspect ratio. For frontier
models that support configurable reasoning or thinking budgets (e.g., GPT and Gemini-3-
Flash), we uniformly set the thinking budget to low for all evaluations to ensure a fair and
consistent comparison. For all other benchmarks, we follow the official evaluation protocols
and metrics. Results are shown in Table 1. Benefiting from the ability to think with visual
primitives, our model achieves competitive performance on these tasks with remarkable token
efficiency. Notably, all frontier models exhibit suboptimal performance on topological reasoning
tasks, suggesting that substantial room for improvement remains in the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models.

- construct two distinct evaluation sets: DS_Maze_Navigation and DS_Path_Tracing,
- comprising 2, 000 instances for both of the two sets.

As shown in Figs. 7 to 9, our model demonstrates strong performance on coarse-grained and
fine-grained counting tasks through thinking with grounding, while also exhibiting emergent
capability synergies. For instance, the model is able to integrate world knowledge for visual
question answering, perform counterfactual reasoning, and provide actionable suggestions with
spatial coordinates tailored to users’ everyday needs. Although our post-training data about
visual primitives does not include any Chinese corpus, the model is capable of thinking and
responding in Chinese, benefiting from the multilingual capabilities inherited from the base
model.

As shown in Fig. 10, our model shows the ability of topological reasoning via thinking with
pointing, producing step-by-step exploration traces for mazes and sequential tracking trajectories
for path tracing. On in-domain instances, the model has the ability to identify and follow the
paths, which is enforced via mitigating the cold start data and rewarding during the specialized
RL process.

Despite these promising results, our current work has certain limitations. First, constrained
by input resolution, the model’s performance in fine-grained scenarios remains sub-optimal,
leading to occasionally imprecise outputs of visual primitives. This could potentially be ad-
dressed by integrating our framework with existing methods targeting the "Perception Gap" to
achieve complementary benefits. Second, the current “thinking with visual primitives” capabil-
ity relies on explicit trigger words for activation. In the future, we aim to enable the model to
autonomously determine whether to invoke this mechanism based on the specific context. Third,
utilizing points as visual primitives to solve complex topological reasoning problems remains
a formidable challenge, and our current model exhibits limited cross-scenario generalization.
Exploring ways to broaden the applicability and robustness of this technique constitutes an
important direction for future research.

To address the inherent “Reference Gap” in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
during complex reasoning, we introduce “Thinking with Visual Primitives”, a novel reasoning
framework. Moving beyond the conventional reliance on simply increasing perceptual reso-
lution, we elevate spatial markers—such as points and bounding boxes—to "minimal units
of thought" and interleave them directly into the model’s thinking process. This mechanism
endows the model with the ability to “point while it reasons”, precisely anchoring abstract
linguistic concepts onto physical image coordinates. Furthermore, leveraging a highly efficient
visual token compression architecture, our model achieves performance on par with frontier
models across highly challenging tasks, including spatial reasoning, visual QA, and topological
reasoning, while significantly reducing image token consumption. Our work demonstrates that
the path to System-2 multimodal intelligence lies not merely in “seeing more pixels”, but in
constructing a precise, unambiguous referential bridge between language and vision.

1. **Understanding the request** 
The user wants me to count the number of Pokémon figures in the image. I need to look for 
characters from the Pokémon franchise among the various toys displayed on the table.
2. **Scanning the table for Pokémon**
 Looking at the collection of figures, I can identify the Pokémon characters: <｜ref｜>pokemons
<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[215,483,368,711],[330,180,422, 348],[465,438,582,638],[581,403,674,588],
[635,195,723,323],[640,244, 814,429]]<｜/box｜>. Breaking this down visually, I see Pikachu on the 
left, Psyduck in the back row, Charmander in the center, Bulbasaur in the front row, Jigglypuff in 
the back right, and Squirtle next to Jigglypuff, partially obscured by the Detective Pikachu figure.
3. **Distinguishing Pokémon from other figures** 
I am making sure not to include characters from other franchises. Specifically, I'm ignoring 
Doraemon on the left, Luffy, Zoro, and the red-hatted figure from One Piece in the front left, the 
Crayon Shin-chan figure in the back center, the female figure, the guy in the detective hat, and the 
boxy character on the far right.
4. **Final count of Pokémon** 
Counting the distinct Pokémon characters found, there are 6 of them.
Response
Based on the image, there are 6 Pokémon figures.

1. **Understanding the weight comparison task** 
The user is asking to determine which of the two objects on the scale is heavier. To answer this, I 
need to locate each object and evaluate the physical evidence provided by the scale's state (which 
side is lower and which is higher).
2. **Locating the left object**
On the left side of the scale, I see a <｜ref｜>large gray metal locker<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[26,41,396,699]]<｜/box｜>. It is constructed with solid, rigid materials and mounted securely 
on the left <｜ref｜>metal tray<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[20,685,393,759]]<｜/box｜> of the balance. 
The locker is rectangular and imposing, suggesting substantial structural mass.
3. **Locating the right object** 
On the right side of the scale, resting on the corresponding <｜ref｜>metal tray<｜/ref｜><｜
box｜>[[636,747,970,860]]<｜/box｜>, is a <｜ref｜>translucent rainbow bear<｜/ref｜><｜
box｜>[[691,407,916,808]]<｜/box｜>. It looks like a large, vibrant gummy bear made of a 
translucent, jelly-like substance.
4. **Evaluating the scale's equilibrium** 
The visual evidence from the balance scale is very clear. The <｜ref｜>metal tray<｜/ref｜><｜
box｜>[[636,747,970,860]]<｜/box｜> on the right is positioned lower to the ground than the <｜
ref｜>metal tray<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[20,685,393,759]]<｜/box｜> on the left. The arm holding 
the right tray is also pointing downward. This means the right side of the scale is heavier.
5. **Conclusion** 
Because the right side containing the gummy bear is lower than the left side containing the locker, 
the bear must be heavier in this scenario.
Response
Based on the scale's tilt, the rainbow bear is heavier.

1. **Defining the target animal** 
The question asks me to count the number of Chihuahuas in the image. I need to focus on 
differentiating the dogs from the blueberry muffins that also appear in the grid. Looking at the 
overall layout, the grid seems to contain alternating photos of dogs and muffins.
2. **Scanning the grid for dogs**
I‘ll search the entire grid to locate every dog. After scanning the rows, I spot the following set of 
distinct Chihuahuas: <｜ref｜>Chihuahuas<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[2,366,233,641],[247,0,498,341],
[255,680,498,997],[499,347,749,670],[743,0,996,317],[743,658,992,997]]<｜/box｜>. These dogs 
appear in the first row (second and fourth columns), the second row (first and third columns), 
and the third row (second and fourth columns). They are mostly a light tan or brownish-white 
color, with large dark eyes and large ears.
3. **Confirming the final count** 
Looking at the identified dogs, I have counted 6 Chihuahuas in total.
Response
There are 6 Chihuahuas in the picture.

1. **初识⼩巷** 
这是⼀张充满古朴与岁⽉感的照⽚，展现了⼀条幽静的巷弄。整个场景有⼀种令⼈放松的安静氛围，似乎
在某个历史悠久的古镇或传统村落⾥。
2. **观察建筑与街道**
⽬光⾸先被左侧的建筑吸引，那⾥有⾼挑的<｜ref｜>深⾊⽊制⻔框<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[2,249,176,
607]]<｜/box｜>，做⼯精致，上⽅还悬挂着<｜ref｜>传统的⽅形灯笼<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[56,219,118,
284]]<｜/box｜>，增添了⼀抹古⾊古⾹的韵味。⽊⻔旁边，⼀⾯<｜ref｜>泥⼟质感的墙壁<｜/ref｜
><｜box｜>[[123,254,341,609]]<｜/box｜> 裸露着，看起来经过岁⽉的洗礼⽽显得斑驳，上⾯还贴着⼀些
颜⾊鲜艳的<｜ref｜>⼩型⼴告海报<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[182,412,259,510]]<｜/box｜>，给旧墙带⼊了
些许现代的⽣活⽓息。视线转向街道中央，是⼀条经典的<｜ref｜>鹅卵⽯铺成的步道<｜/ref｜><｜
box｜>[[0,554,675,995]]<｜/box｜>。步道由不规则的⽯块拼嵌⽽成，中间的平整⽯板和两侧圆润的砾⽯相
互交替，纹理⾮常清晰。迈步向巷⼦深处看去，可以看到更远处的<｜ref｜>经典⽼式建筑<｜/ref｜><｜
box｜>[[320,330,515,555]]<｜/box｜>，它们保持着传统的坡屋顶和⽊质结构，层层叠叠，延伸向远⽅。
3. **探索右侧庭院** 
在巷⼦的右侧，我发现了⼀扇<｜ref｜>带有竖条栅栏的⽊⻔<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[481,433,536,563]]<｜
/box｜>，透着⼏分神秘。紧挨着这道⽊⻔，是⼀⾯<｜ref｜>⽼旧的⼟⻩⾊⽯墙<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[525,231,981,726]]<｜/box｜>，墙⾯粗糙且颜⾊饱满。⽊⻔上嵌着⼀块<｜ref｜>⽊质牌匾<｜/ref｜
><｜box｜>[[556,386,616,472]]<｜/box｜>，上⾯刻着字。墙根下的条形⽯台上，错落有致地摆放着⼏盆
植物和扎染布艺装饰，显得⽣机盎然。
4. **感受整体氛围** 
这条⼩巷完整地保留了传统建筑⻛貌与原始的⽯板路⾯，加上两侧的植物点缀，呈现出⼀种耐⼈寻味的古
韵与宁静感。从照⽚中的⽼建筑⻛格、尤其是⽊⻔与⽯墙的构建⽅式来看，这⾥极有可能是我曾⻅过⼀些
资料的中国云南古镇，例如丽江、沙溪或类似的⽩族、纳⻄族聚居区。

Image with Visual Primitives

1. **Initial impression of the image** 
This is a side-by-side comparison image. The left side shows a chunk of fruit (maybe a pear or apple) with 
a face-like indentation and dark marks. The right side shows a close-up of a cat's face. It looks like 
someone carved the fruit to look exactly like the cat.
2. **Locating and explaining the resemblance**
I'm looking for the visual similarities. On the left, I see a <｜ref｜>fruit chunk<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[75,303,414,758]]<｜/box｜>. Within its pale flesh, there are natural dark spots that look like eyes. 
Specifically, there is a <｜ref｜>circular black spot<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[185,463,244,552]]<｜/box｜> 
that perfectly mimics a pupil. Additionally, twisted fiber or skin at the bottom of the fruit chunk looks like 
a <｜ref｜>dark, textured nose<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[273,519,369,655]]<｜/box｜>. Now looking at the 
right, there is a <｜ref｜>cat's white face<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[530,284,999,888]]<｜/box｜> filling the 
frame. I can see a pair of <｜ref｜>green eyes<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[594,547,690,617]]<｜/box｜>, 
looking absolutely devastated or sad. Below the eyes is a <｜ref｜>small pink nose<｜/ref｜><｜box｜
>[[755,715,842,786]]<｜/box｜> located between the cheeks.
3. **Drawing the conclusion** 
The humor comes from the 'devastated' expression on the cat's face being perfectly replicated by the 
randomly shaped marks on the fruit. It looks like the fruit is a raw, unedited version of the cat's soul-
piercing sadness. The comparison is spot on, making it funny.

This is funny because the piece of fruit on the left has natural dark spots that form a face looking 
remarkably similar to the sad, green-eyed cat on the right. The similarities in the "eyes" and "nose" create a 
hilarious, uncanny resemblance between the two.

1. **初步观察** 
我环顾四周，发现⾃⼰⾝处⼀个封闭的室内环境。墙⾯粗糙，左侧有⼀扇带有铁栅栏的窗户，右侧是⼀扇
关闭的⽊⻔。眼前最引⼈注⽬的是⾼处架⼦上的⼀把⾦⾊钥匙。我需要找到逃出去的⽅法。
2. **寻找潜在线索**
我注意到墙⾯上⾼悬着<｜ref｜>⼀把发光的⾦⾊钥匙<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[566,110,649,165]]<｜/box｜
>，它似乎在暗示我这是解锁的关键。⽊架上并没有可视的楼梯或踏板。⽊⻔下⽅，我看到<｜ref｜>⼀个
带有⾦属⻔把⼿和锁孔的深⾊⽊制⻔<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[665,231,991,910]]<｜/box｜>，这显然是需要
钥匙才能打开的出⼝。在房间中央的地板上，摆放在我⾯前的<｜ref｜>⼀把简单的⽊制椅⼦<｜/ref｜
><｜box｜>[[399,554,603,936]]<｜/box｜>。它的位置似乎有些特殊。
3. **整合信息与推理** 
⽬前我⾯临的核⼼问题是如何拿到⾼处架⼦上的钥匙。我只有⼀把普通⾼度的⽊制椅⼦，直接伸⼿是够不
到钥匙的。观察⻔把⼿和椅⼦的位置，它们都在房间的较低⾼度，⽽光线和我的注意⼒都集中在上⽅。我
意识到，这很可能是⼀个简单的物理谜题。如果我移动这把椅⼦，把它推到⻔边或架⼦下⽅，我或许能够
踩在上⾯够到钥匙。
4. **得出结论** 
综合来看，要逃出这个房间，最直接的策略是：先移动这把低矮的椅⼦，将其挪到悬挂着⾦⾊钥匙的墙壁
或架⼦下⽅，然后利⽤椅⼦作为垫脚⽯，伸⼿取下钥匙，最后⾛到右侧的⽊⻔处⽤钥匙开⻔。

要逃出⽣天，你可以把⽊椅移动到挂着钥匙的架⼦下⽅，踩着椅⼦拿到钥匙，然后去开右侧的⻔。

1. **Understanding the task** 
I need to count the number of people visible in the image. The picture is a large group portrait featuring 
several rows of individuals, so I need to scan carefully from the back to the front to ensure no one is 
missed.
2. **Scanning the group for individuals**
I'll look across the entire frame, identifying heads, faces, and bodies to pick out each individual. Sweeping 
across the arrangement of people, I find all of them: <｜ref｜>people<｜/ref｜><｜box｜>[[4,459,80, 
859],[32,506,147,900],[105,477,189,883],[107,335,202,638],[136,502,250,893],[202,362,276,616],[210,463,289,82
6],[248,499,363,894],[265,386,335,617],[307,455,419,835],[341,383,416,596],[355,510,478,898],[413,392,501,611
],[425,447,529,835],[483,489,608,895],[487,374,584,576],[539,450,623,824],[582,374,664,594],[582,498,685,889],
[626,471,714,817],[658,371,750,591],[684,508,774,887],[720,469,812,844],[737,365,816,603],[768,510,879,895],[
788,320,882,601],[824,470,919,889],[828,370,930,625],[856,529,989,891]]<｜/box｜>. This includes people in 
the very back standing tall, those standing in the middle slightly hunched forward to be seen, and the 
individuals seated on chairs in the very front.
3. **Final count confirmation** 
Counting the distinct individuals I just located across the entire group, I find 29 people in total.

Thinking with Visual Primitives
Okay, let me analyze the structure of this maze step by step. First locate the starting point: <｜point｜>[[555,499]]<｜/point｜>, and the destination: 
<｜point｜>[[247,416]]<｜/point｜>.

**Start Exploring**:

**Step1**: Arriving at <｜point｜>[[555,499]]<｜/point｜>, I see 2 paths ahead (counter-clockwise, outward). The counter-clockwise direction is also 
passable, but from the maze layout, outward direction's path looks wider.
**Step2**: At <｜point｜>[[597,472]]<｜/point｜>, I notice 2 directions to choose from (clockwise, counter-clockwise).Although counter-clockwise 
direction is also walkable, after observing path structure, I judge clockwise direction more likely leads to exit.
**Step3**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[600,594]]<｜/point｜>, I face 2 forks (clockwise, outward).Let me try outward direction first.
**Step4**: Moving outward: <｜point｜>[[600,594],[660,667],[720,705]]<｜/point｜>...reaching <｜point｜>[[720,705]]<｜/point｜>, I see 2 forks here. 
Observing that up direction is a straight dead end at <｜point｜>[[740,620]]<｜/point｜>, can see wall directly. Still need to explore the continuing 
outward direction.
**Step5**: Pushing clockwise: <｜point｜>[[720,705],[660,750]]<｜/point｜>...but hit a wall at <｜point｜>[660,750]]<｜/point｜>. It's a dead end, must 
backtrack to the previous fork <｜point｜>[[720,705]]<｜/point｜>.
**Step6**: All paths in this branch are explored, all dead ends. Going back to main junction <｜point｜>[[600,594]]<｜/point｜>, taking clockwise 
direction.
**Step7**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[544,682]]<｜/point｜>, I face 3 forks (inward, outward, outward).Comparing to inward direction, outward direction's 
passage characteristics are more like a main path.
**Step8**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[532,720]]<｜/point｜>, I face 2 forks (clockwise, outward).The outward direction is also passable, but from the maze 
layout, clockwise direction's path looks wider.
**Step9**: At <｜point｜>[[471,722]]<｜/point｜>, I notice 2 directions to choose from (clockwise, inward).Although inward direction is also walkable, 
after observing path structure, I judge clockwise direction more likely leads to exit.
**Step10**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[415,683]]<｜/point｜>, I face 2 forks (clockwise, outward).Although outward direction is also walkable, after 
observing path structure, I judge clockwise direction more likely leads to exit.
**Step11**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[371,637]]<｜/point｜>, I face 2 forks (inward, outward).Comparing to outward direction, inward direction's passage 
characteristics are more like a main path.
**Step12**: At <｜point｜>[[378,567]]<｜/point｜>, I notice 3 directions to choose from (clockwise, inward, outward).The inward, outward direction is 
also passable, but from the maze layout, clockwise direction's path looks wider.
**Step13**: At <｜point｜>[[396,467]]<｜/point｜>, I notice 2 directions to choose from (outward, outward).After eliminating dead ends, outward is the 
best choice.
**Step14**: Reaching <｜point｜>[[368,397]]<｜/point｜>, I face 2 forks (clockwise, outward).The outward direction is also passable, but from the maze 
layout, clockwise direction's path looks wider.
**Step15**: At <｜point｜>[[330,355]]<｜/point｜>, I notice 2 directions to choose from (outward, outward).After eliminating dead ends, clockwise is the 
best choice.
**Step16**: Continuing outward: <｜point｜>[[330,355],[300,450]]<｜/point｜>. Keeping this direction.
**Step17**: Looking in outward direction, I can directly see the path to the exit, no need to linger at the junction: <｜point｜> 
[[300,450],[265,472],[247,416]]<｜/point｜>
**Step18**: Arriving at <｜point｜>[[247,416]]<｜/point｜>, I finally see the exit!

Successfully reaching the destination: <｜point｜>[[247,416]]<｜/point｜>!

<｜point｜>[[555,499],[597,472],[600,594],[544,682],[532,720],[471,722],[415,683],[371,637],[378,587],[396,467],[368,397],[330,355],[300,450],[265,472],[247,416]]
<｜/point｜>

Response
The maze is solvable. The verified path is:
<｜point｜>[[555,499],[597,472],[600,594],[544,682],[532,720],[471,722],[415,683],[371,637],[378,587],[396,467],[368,397],[330,355],[300,450],[265,472],[247,416]]
<｜/point｜>
[\boxed{True}]

Thinking with Visual Primitives
I find the starting point you mentioned, it's located here: 
<｜point｜>[[195,594]]<｜/point｜>.
Following this beige line, the visual path I observe is:<｜point｜> 
[[195,594],[319,617],[338,626],[342,588],[375,547],[438,522],[508,512],[565,5
05],[604,490],[609,464],[595,427],[579,391],[580,364],[606,358],[661,372],[72
0,408],[765,442],[803,458]]<｜/point｜>
Following this path, it connects to: <｜point｜>[[803,457]]<｜/point｜>

Response
Based on the visual trace, the endpoint is 5. [\boxed{5}]
